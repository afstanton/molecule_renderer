The intent of this package is to be able to take a valid "molecule_core" data structure and render the described chemical. This should be able to handle both 3d rendering and 2d. The plan is for this to be able to work on all platforms that Flutter supports as a drop in component to add proper functionality to a Flutter app.

## Features

Right now this is just a placeholder for future development.

## Getting started

Documentation will be added as this fills out.

## Usage

There are no suitable examples on how to use this yet.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```

## Additional information

At present, this is a placeholder that other packages will reference, and functionality will be added to this as needed. Once it becomes useful, suggestions will be welcome.
